    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm, which shows cool results in challenging domains such as Go and chess. The algorithm builds a search tree, iteratively traverses it, and evaluates its nodes using a Monte-Carlo simulation.\n",
    "\n",

    "__1) Selection__\n",
    "Starting from the root, recursively select the node that corresponds to the tree policy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options for tree policies, which we saw earlier as exploration strategies: epsilon-greedy, Thomson sampling, UCB-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2) Expansion__\n",
    "After the selection procedure, we can achieve a leaf node or node in which we don't complete actions. In this case, we expand the tree by feasible actions and get new state nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__3) Simulation__\n",
    "How we can estimate node Q-values? The idea is to estimate action values for a given _rollout policy_ by averaging the return of many simulated trajectories from the current node. Simply, we can play with random or some special policy or use some model that can estimate it.\n",

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of assumptions is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Finite number of actions__: we enumerate all actions in `expand`.\n",
    "* __Episodic (finite) MDP__: while technically it works for infinite MDPs, we perform a rollout for $10^4$ steps. If you are knowingly infinite, please adjust `t_max` to something more reasonable.\n",
    "* __Deterministic MDP__: `Node` represents the single outcome of taking `self.action` in `self.parent`, and does not support the situation where taking an action in a state may lead to different rewards and next states.\n",
    "* __No discounted rewards__: we assume $\\gamma=1$. If that isn't the case, you only need to change two lines in `rollout()` and use `my_qvalue = self.immediate_reward + gamma * child_qvalue` for `propagate()`.\n",
    "* __pickleable env__: won't work if e.g. your env is connected to a web-browser surfing the internet. For custom envs, you may need to modify get_snapshot/load_snapshot from `WithSnapshots`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On `get_best_leaf` and `expand` functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This MCTS implementation only selects leaf nodes for expansion.\n",
    "This doesn't break things down because `expand` adds all possible actions. Hence, all non-leaf nodes are by design fully expanded and shouldn't be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to only add a few random action on each expand, you will also have to modify `get_best_leaf` to consider returning non-leafs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rollout policy\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simple uniform policy for rollouts. This introduces a negative bias to good situations that can be messed up completely with random bad action. As a simple example, if you tend to rollout with uniform policy, you better don't use sharp knives and walk near cliffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve that by integrating a reinforcement _learning_ algorithm with a computationally light agent. You can even train this agent on optimal policy found by the tree search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contributions\n",
